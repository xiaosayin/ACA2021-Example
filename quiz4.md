# What's your choice for the trolley problem? Would you switch the lever (sacrifice one individual and save five lives), and why?

My tram problem here is described in detail as follows: 5 children are on a track that is not allowed to play, and the other is on an abandoned track.

I'd like to choose not to switch lever. Because the kid on the side track is the only one who obeys the rules.And the other 5 children did not abide by the traffic rules. I think we can’t sacrifice those who follow the rules and save those who don’t.


# Please find a related problem to the trolley problem (e.g., the fat man, the loop variant) and describe the difference between this problem and the trolley problem.

## Fat man problem
You are standing on the overpass and you see a tram with a broken brake speeding up. There are five workers in front of the track. They don't know the situation. A fat passerby is standing next to you, and you find that his huge size and weight (this question does not discriminate against fat people) can just block the tram, derail the tram, and avoid the five workers.

Should you push down the fat man to save the five workers, or watch the tram hit them?

## Difference
The difference between this problem and the tram problem is that if you want to save 5 people, you have to kill the fat man yourself, not just push the lever.

This shows that the moral intuition possessed by human beings operates like utilitarianism in the first situation, and acts like a moral deontologist in the second situation.
